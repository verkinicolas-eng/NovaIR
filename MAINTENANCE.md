# Maintenance Policy

## Project Status

**NovaIR is a research prototype released as a community gift.**

This project demonstrates the viability of a declarative paradigm for system regulation. It is not a production-ready product.

## Support Expectations

### What This Means

- **No guaranteed support** — Issues may or may not be addressed
- **No SLA** — Response times are not guaranteed
- **Best effort** — Contributions are welcome but not required
- **No roadmap** — Future development is not planned or promised

### Issues & Pull Requests

- Issues are welcome for bug reports and feature ideas
- Pull requests are welcome and will be reviewed when possible
- There is no guarantee that issues will be fixed or PRs merged
- Be patient — this is a side project

### If You Need Production Support

If you need NovaIR for production use:

1. **Fork the repository** — Create your own maintained version
2. **Hire a contractor** — Commission the features you need
3. **Build in-house** — Use NovaIR as inspiration for your own solution
